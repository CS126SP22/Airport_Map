# Project Proposal

## Project Overview
For my final project, I would like to create a routing project using graph search algorithm like A* algorithm 
and visualize it. Within a given map, I can calculate the shortest path from the starting point to the destination point.
The map is analogous to a graph where each coordinate is a node and the edges represent the movements the car can make
to each surrounding node. In this project, I only consider 4 possible moves from each node: up right left down. At the end,
I will visualize the map and the shortest path.

## Background and Reason
I take CS437 Internet of Things this semester, and we implement self-navigation raspberry car in Lab 1. In this lab, I use 
A* algorithm to help my car find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination point. And these path-finding algorithms
are broadly used in Google Map. So I would like to implement this path-finding algorithm and visualize it by myself.

## Timeline
- Week 1: Create Node Class, Graph Class, etc., and several member functions. Create the test for them. Implement the path-finding algorithm and create the test for it
- Week 2: After finishing the path-finding problem, I will start to visualize the map and the shortest path using Cinder library
- Week 3: Wrap them together, and add more features to it such as load the provided map and save the output map. At the end, create tests for my final project. 
- Week 4: Implement other path-finding algorithm like Dijkstra's Algorithm and compare them. And add more features like setting the edge weight and the edge direction.

## Stretch Goals
If I were to finish the final project early, I would implement other path-finding algorithms and compare them.,
